Luxor 3 Map Editor
by Mima Explorer
This map editor is a tool that eases the process of making a Luxor 3 map via NODE. It contains several options, such as reloading the background, saving the entire path to be copied into
.lx3trk, or even automaticaly zoning out the map!
HOW TO USE:
- Click to add vertices (visible by default)
- If you want to change vertice visibility, press H
- Press S to save the files
- In case you want a new background, simply replace the background.png and press R
- Mute the music on M
- Press E to open the all important Object Editor
  OBJECT EDITOR:
  The object editor allows you to add reflectors, canopic jars and splits(WIP) to the level, as well as doing the auto-zoning.
  -REFLECTOR MODE (F)
  In reflector mode, click the screen to add reflectors. Upon clicking, go to console and input target coordinates (will be automatic soon)
  -JAR MODE (J)
  In jar mode, click the screen to add canopic jars and golden scarabs. Upon clicking, the jar will be added in
  -SPLIT MODE (P)
  In split mode, clicking the screen adds splits. Unfortunately, the splits aren't going to the .lx3trk files, so they aren't working (for now)
  Zoning(Z/Y)
  Pressing the Z or Y key will automatically zone the map into multiple zones:
  -initial (0-2)
  -occlude (3-5th to last)
  -pyramid gate (4th to last, 3rd to last)
  -pyramid (last two)
